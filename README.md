# lvgl-lua-binding
lua + lvgl = luavgl

**luavgl is currently under development.**

A flappy bird game is ready for showoff. See simulator instructions below which is tested on ubuntu and mac but not windows.

## Introduction

`luavgl` is a wrapper around lvgl **core** functions and **widgets** with class inherence in mind, which is lvgl trying to do in `C`. Lua makes widgets inherence happens smoothly.

`luavgl` does not support APIs for low level hardware initialization, lvgl setup etc. Those initialization must be done before executing lua scripts.

`luavgl` mainly targets for embedded device, a simulator has been provided for preview and tested on Ubuntu/macOS.

```lua
local root = lvgl.Object()
root:set { w = lvgl.HOR_RES(), h = lvgl.VER_RES() }

-- flex layout and align
root:set {
    flex = {
        flex_direction = "row",
        flex_wrap = "wrap",
        justify_content = "center",
        align_items = "center",
        align_content = "center",
    },
    w = 300,
    h = 75,
    align = lvgl.ALIGN.CENTER
}

-- create obj on root
local obj = root:Object()

-- create image on root and set position/img src/etc. properties.
local img = root:Image {
    src = "res/image.png",
    x = 0,
    y = 0,
    bg_color = "#112233" -- #RRGGBB, 0xRRGGBB or "#RGB"
    pad_all = 0
}

-- change image properties.

img:set {
    src = "/assets/lvgl-logo.png",
    align = lvgl.ALIGN.CENTER,
}

-- create animation on object
img:Anim {
    run = true,
    start_value = 0,
    end_value = 3600,
    duration = 2000,
    repeat_count = 2,
    path = "bounce",
    exec_cb = function(obj, value)
        obj:set {
            angle = value
        }
    end
}

-- create Label on root and set its font
local label = root:Label {
    text = string.format("Hello %03d", 123),
    text_font = lvgl.Font("montserrat", 24, "normal"),
    -- or builtin font:
    -- text_font = lvgl.BUILTIN_FONT.MONTSERRAT_22,
    align = {
        type = lvgl.ALIGN.CENTER,
        x_ofs = 0,
        y_ofs = 100,
    }
}

```

### Embedded device

For embedded device, lvgl environment must setup before using `luavgl`. Once `lvgl` and `lua interpreter` are up and running, add the `luavgl.c` to sources for compiling. And make sure `luaopen_lvgl` is added to global lib. Below is example from `simulator/main.c` shows this exact method.

```c
  /* add `lvgl` module to global package table */
  luaL_requiref(L, "lvgl", luaopen_luavgl, 1);
  lua_pop(L, 1);
```

### LuaJIT support

Supporting `LuaJIT` is done by adding `deps/lua-compat-5.3`.

### Developing

I personally using `vscode` plus extension [`Lua`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua).

File `src/lvgl.lua` is used for linting.

### Run on RTOS nuttx

Check the ready-to-go examples [luavgl-nuttx-example](https://github.com/XuNeo/luavgl-nuttx-example)

### PC simulator

**Currently compile luavgl to `so` or `dll` is NOT available.**

`luavgl` depends on lvgl and various configurations(`lv_conf.h`), thus cannot run without a working lvgl environment.
The simulator provided in this repo can be used as example if `luavgl` is required on PC.

Make sure clone the submodules, luavgl simulator comes directly from lvgl simulator with lua added.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/XuNeo/luavgl.git

# or
git submodule update --init
```

#### Dependencies

To run simulator on PC, make sure `lua` header is available, you may need to install below packages.

```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev
```

Both lua5.3 and lua5.4 are supported. Versions below 5.2 has not been verified but should work through `deps/lua-compat-5.3`.

#### Build and run

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -DBUILD_SIMULATOR=ON
cd build
make
make run # run simulator
```
## Custom Widget

`luavgl` support custom widget, and use them in `lua` just like lvgl core widgets.
An example is provided in [`simulator/extension.c`](https://github.com/XuNeo/luavgl/blob/master/simulator/extension.c#L62)

For custom widget, it should be registered to Lua after luavgl lib loaded.
